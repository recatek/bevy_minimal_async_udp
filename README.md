# bevy_minimal_async_udp

A barebones example of async UDP in bevy, with separate threads for sending and receiving messages that can interact with bevy systems. Contains a client and a server crate. Does not include serialization, connection/session management, pings, or any other protocol -- just raw data I/O.
